    // whole page (fresh WHEP negotiation + fresh DOM) — the adb-independent
    // replacement for the Fully Kiosk auto-reload we lost on com.tcl.browser.

    // The rule is deliberately conservative: it fires ONLY after a long
    // no-decoded-frames window that a normal reconnect cannot reach, so it
