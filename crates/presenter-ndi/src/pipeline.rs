//! Per-source GStreamer pipeline: one shared-encoder ENCODER pipeline plus one
//! FRESH pipeline per WHEP consumer, bridged by `gstreamer_utils::StreamProducer`.
//!
//! Each `NdiPipeline` instance corresponds to ONE active NDI source. The
//! ENCODER pipeline is built once and NEVER modified afterwards:
//!
//! ```text
//! ndisrc → ndisrcdemux → videoconvert → videoscale → caps(NV12,720p) → raw_tee
//!                audio ↘ fakesink
//!  (default) raw_tee → q_default → encoder → profile_caps → h264parse
//!                        → enc_appsink                  (1280×720 H264)
//!  (compat)  raw_tee → q_compat → videorate → videoconvert → videoscale
//!                        → compat_scale_caps(I420 854×480 @20)
//!                        → encoder_compat(vp8enc)
//!                        → enc_appsink_compat   (854×480@20 realtime VP8)
//!                       (one encoder per PROFILE — never per consumer)
//!                                      StreamProducer fanout (one per profile)
//!                                                            ▼
//!   per consumer (its OWN gst::Pipeline): appsrc → rtph264pay|rtpvp8pay
//!                                                            → webrtcbin
//! ```
//!
//! Profile rule (realtime-VP8 pivot): a consumer is served the profile its
//! WHEP POST requested via the `?profile=compat` query ([`StreamProfile`],
//! parsed at the HTTP layer) — compat is the VDO.Ninja-style realtime VP8
//! stream for weak TVs whose H264 OMX decoder is vendor-broken; every other
//! consumer gets the default 720p H264 stream. The profile IMPLIES the codec
//! ([`StreamProfile::encoding_name`]); the WHEP answer dictates it to the
//! browser (every browser offer carries both H264 and VP8).
//!
//! Why per-consumer pipelines: a `webrtcbin` added to an already-running LIVE
//! pipeline never gets its rtpsession's running-time/latency configured, so
//! every straggler/reconnect connected but received ZERO RTP — the #373
//! black-stage bug. Running each consumer in its OWN pipeline (sharing the
//! encoder pipeline's clock + base-time, with a per-pipeline `Latency` bus
//! handler) makes the latency configuration deterministic. This is EXACTLY the
//! architecture of gst-plugin-rs `webrtcsink` (one session pipeline per peer,
//! `StreamProducer` bridge, `Latency` message → `recalculate_latency()`), which
//! is the reference implementation this design follows.
//!
//! The appsink→appsrc bridge is `gstreamer_utils::StreamProducer` — the same
//! battle-tested fanout `webrtcsink` uses. It forwards samples (caps, segment
//! and PTS preserved), propagates the producer's latency to every consumer
//! appsrc, gates each new consumer on a keyframe, and forwards the browser's
//! force-keyunit (PLI) requests upstream to the shared encoder.
//!
//! Per-consumer state lives in `WhepSession` (`whep_session.rs`). The pipeline
//! owns the shared encoder + the producer and a `tokio::sync::Mutex<HashMap<
//! String, WhepSession>>` of active sessions.
//!
//! Structure: the type definitions live here in the module root; the
//! `impl NdiPipeline` methods are split across focused submodules
//! (`build`, `lifecycle`, `consumers`) to keep each file well under the
//! project's file-size cap. Private struct fields stay accessible to those
//! submodules because they are descendants of this module.
